Week 1 and 2
- Normalisation of a problem in the BFS model with CRRA utility and multiplicative transition equation of the permanent income
- Markov operator, density kernel, multiplicative law of motion
- Persistent vs permanent income shocks in buffer stock savings (Druedahl, Jorgensen 2016)
- Aggregating heterogeneous agent models with permanent income shocks (Harmenberg, 2021)
- computing Euler equation with dynamic programming, lagrangian static, value function iterated (base and howard improved), Time iterated (base, improved, endogeneous grid points) 
- seminars: Basile Grassi about markup, Julia Cage about politically driven donations,
- Julia: Setting up github, building a function, fields, broadcast, data type
- Dolo, dolark, hark, theoretical foundations of buffer stock savings
- log-normal shock, say mean 1, can take value -1, but then you take exponential, and thus it is never negative but between 0 and 1.
