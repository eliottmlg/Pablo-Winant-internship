# rest of things to do for my internship report

## preface 
- ask chloe for her preface

## julia
- investigate why julia is faster than another language, high-level programming, can differentiate any object, less technological debts because all written in julia unlike matlab which is originally an interface to fortran

- explain the multiple dispatch and where you use it 

- particularly performant for loops, programming dynamics

- maniere dont julia compile, different than how python compiles 

## algorithms
- value function

- time iteration not to be confused with policy iteration 

- egm which is an implementation of time iteration, that is use the same optimality conditions as the TI but computes in a different way to make it faster (in particular same value of decision rule at each iteration)

## egm 
- class of models that can be handled 
  
- multiple controls

- only one poststate

## implementations 
- produce results for VI, TI and EGM

- computing time and plot decision rules
